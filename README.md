# React-Chessboard

A chessboard UI created as a react component. 

This is meant as a UI layer designed to be integrated with [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md) to handle the game logic. 

The main chessboard component is in `src/ChessBoard.js`. Integration with chess.js is demonstrated in `App.js`.
